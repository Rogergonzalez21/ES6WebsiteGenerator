# ES6WebsiteGenerator

This is my ES6 Website basic scaffolding. All my ES6 websites will inherit from this repo. It uses:

* Gulp
* Gulp webserver
* HTMLmin
* CSSNano
* Browserify
* Uglify

Output is going to be created on the `build` folder, ready to be uploaded.

Feel free to use it whenever you want!
